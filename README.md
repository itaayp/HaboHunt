# Habo Hunt

## About
A quick hunting game, where 10 markers were distirbuted on Habonim Dror's house, and anyone could open the APP and hunt for them.
After reading all markers, user has all clues he need to guess 1 of the 5 sorted 'secret word'.

## How it works
- When first start, it randomly chooses a `activePath` 
- Each path has a different sequence of clues
- Currently there are 10 markers registered
- Each path has a certain amount of clues to be collected
- Each clue is a letter 
- The clues are shown in order they are collected
- Some markers may not have clues for some `path`.
- Gather all usefull marks and figure out the final word

## The Markers
- This uses 3x3 2d Barcode marker
- This uses marker #1 to #10
- PNG files that you can print are available at [./_markers](./_markers) folder
- There is [this Marker Generator](http://au.gmented.com/app/marker/marker.php) on the Webs

**Important** specially on iOS, the marker borders must be clear (about 1cm clear), or the camera will have trouble reading it.
